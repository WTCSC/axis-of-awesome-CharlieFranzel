**AXIS OF AWESOME**

This program takes some *fun* statistics about the U.S. spending on science and technology research and compares it with some data about suicides by strangulation/hanging.

**How it Works**

- Takes the statistics retrived from the sources
- Uses Pandas to plot the data
- Configures titles labels etc.
